## Architecture Overview

Pump Fun UI is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- Next.js: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- Ethers.js: Library for interacting with Ethereum
- RainbowKit: Ethereum wallet connection library
- Wagmi: React hooks for EVM chains
- lightweight-charts: Charting libraries for data visualization

The application follows a component-based architecture, with reusable UI components and hooks for managing state and interactions with the blockchain.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=backend-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_BONDING_CURVE_MANAGER_ADDRESS="contract-address"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_BASE_URL=https://backend-url
CHAINSAFE_API_KEY=your_chainsafe_api_key
CHAINSAFE_BUCKET_ID=your_chainsafe_bucket_id
```

### 🚀 Looking to build a platform like four.meme?

I've made the UI open-source, but the backend and smart contract are closed-source. If you're interested in creating a full-fledged four.meme-like platform, let's collaborate! [Contact me on Telegram](https://t.me/midaBricoll) for more details.
I can also provide the fourmeme-fork contract and backend so that you can get the entire set of platform from me.
